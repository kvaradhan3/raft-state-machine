* merging messages and timeouts

1. one idea is to have a queue for both messages and timeouts
2. a change in the queue triggers possible state change and/or potential actions

* create separate handlers

Instead of putting everything into a queue, create special io handlers for each
state.

In the follower state, one simple code could be to just block on an event, 
either a message event or a timeout event, if a valid message event arrives,
then discard the event timeout, else trigger for the next event.
